A simple app built on top of the Star Wars API (swappi.dev). I used this project to start learning about APIs and how to consume data from them. Built with react, bootstrap and sass.
Main functionalities include:
- The user is able to see the complete list of star wars characters which is provided through a call to swappi API.
- The user can search the list for a specific character.
- The user can see detailed information about every character, which is provided by a different call to the API.
- The user can select two characters and simulate a fight between them.
